## ðŸ“‹ Task Overview

- **Objective:** Develop an autonomous system to inspect ArUco markers and simulated maintenance panels.
- **Robot Arm:** Remote control of a **UR3 robotic arm** via ROS.
- **Computer Vision:** ArUco detection using **OpenCV** with automatic pose storage and movement logging.
- **Integration:** Custom ROS 2 nodes for ArUco recognition, target positioning, and task replay.
- ðŸ›°**Use Case:** Designed for roverâ€“arm cooperation in remote field maintenance and inspection.
